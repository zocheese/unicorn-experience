                  <p>An older person can be described by simply looking at their age but it often is not a great way to describe a specific individual. It’s useful because there are certain things that are common in certain age bands, but that’s a very general description, and it doesn't help us when we’re looking at individual patients.

<br><br>As an example, we do know that dementia gets more common as people get older, but the majority of people who are older don’t have dementia, and if we made an assumption that someone had dementia simply based on their age we’d be quite incorrect. Part of the reason why it’s so difficult to use age as the only factor for an older person is that there’s quite a diverse range of physiological health in people who are older.

<br><br>Another way of assessing someone’s health is by using the concept of frailty. Frailty is a way of describing someone’s function or sometimes a burden of disease. Frailty describes an individual who has less physiological reserve which means that they have a poorer chance of withstanding a physiological stress, like an illness or perhaps a poorer chance of recovering.

<br><br>It can be described a variety of ways and you can describe it by looking at the phenotype, or the appearance of the person that can be measured quite specifically, so how strong someone is their by ability to grip or squeeze or how fast they can walk, how much energy they have for example or whether they are losing weight or maintaining weight. That’s one specific way of describing frailty.

<br><br>You can have a more overall or general approach which is a health provider’s assessment. And that can look at whether someone is able to do all the tasks they normally would, and don’t need any assistance, or they need some assistance with tasks or activities, or whether they’re completely bed bound. That overarching view of whether someone’s frail or not is also valid, but quite broad.

<br><br>A third way of looking at whether someone is frail or not is looking at their disease burden. It can be as simple as counting up all the different illnesses or different diseases someone has and comparing them to a list of problems they could potentially have. All three methods are ways of describing frailty and they all carry implications with regard to health outcome. So people who are more frail tend to have worse health outcomes than people who are less frail.
The preferred method is to do a comprehensive assessment of the older person, generally utilising a multidisciplinary team approach. The assessment of older people requires a multidisciplinary approach because the breadth and depth of problems can’t be met frequently by a single health provider. Having the allied health nursing and medical team working as a team makes it easier and more comprehensive to assess the breadth and depth of an older person’s health and function.
